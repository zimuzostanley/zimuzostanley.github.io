This, is my first post. I'm not sure why I named it the time of writing. Hmmm... 
I've been planning on writing for a very long time. I took the plunge a few weeks ago and setup my *.github.io* page. 
Since then I've been musing about what to write about (early (or late) signs of procrastination).

I have finally decided what to blog about. I would say Linear algebra, but I hope to finish the [book](http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Edition/dp/0030105676)
I'm reading someday, and I don't hope to close the blog when that happens. So I'm going to write about Math generally.
I am not a professor (hope to be someday). I did not study Math as a degree. I am not popular.
I am just an enthusiast, with interests, (Math is one of them). I am learning and I hope this medium makes me serious
with my learning goals, and yes, helps others learn too.

I have a life, so once in a while (maybe more often), I'd rant. I'd write about the little programming I do.
I'd try to mind my language when I'm pissed!
